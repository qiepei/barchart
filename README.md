========

You can show data in BarCharts by this lib, whose render engine is bulit by DOM.<br/>
What you need to do is to get data by ajax or other ways, create a BarChart object, and updata it by options.<br/>
You wanna some special effects such as animation and interaction? This lib will help you.<br/>
You're worrying about the compatibbility of the IEs? Ohh, DOM works on every browser.<br/>
Try it!
