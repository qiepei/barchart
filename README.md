========

You can show data in BarCharts by this lib, whose render engine is bulit by DOM.
What you need to do is to get data by ajax or other ways, create a BarChart object, and updata it by options.
You wanna some special effects such as animation and interaction? This lib will help you.
You're worrying about the compatibbility of the IEs? Ohh, DOM works on every browser.
Try it!
